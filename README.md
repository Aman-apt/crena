# Web Analytics (Extended)

This project is built on top of [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet).  
Shynet is already great for privacy-friendly, cookie-less tracking.  
The goal here is to add more useful features that make it easier to understand how people use your site.

---

## Features to Add
- **Custom events** – track things like button clicks, downloads, form submissions.  
- **Funnels** – see how many users move from step A → B → C.  
- **Retention / cohorts** – check if users come back after a few days or weeks.  
- **Real-time dashboard** – who’s on the site right now, live traffic updates.  
- **Alerts** – get notified if traffic suddenly spikes or drops.  
- **Bot filtering** – cut out fake/spammy visits.  
- **Better charts** – filters, comparisons, and cleaner dashboards.  
- **APIs & exports** – pull data into other tools or get CSV/JSON.  
- **Privacy tools** – data deletion, retention limits, optional extra anonymization.  
- **Mobile support** – iOS/Android SDKs for apps.

## Why?
I want something that’s:
- **Simple** to use  
- **Private** by default  
- **Useful** for both small projects and bigger ones
